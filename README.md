#msc-maximum-likelihood-estimation

This repo contains the code of the machine learning aspect of the thesis I did as part of my MSc Aerospace Dynamics at Cranfield University in 2015.

Title: Flight Dynamics Modelling and System Identification of a Light Fixed Wing UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).

The code is not maintained.

It requires the [SIDPAC (System Identififcation Programcs for AirCrafts)](https://software.nasa.gov/software/LAR-16100-1) package provided by NASA. Specifically the following files:
1. xsmep.m
2. deriv.m
3. oe.m
4. model_disp.m
5. tlonssd.m
6. m_colores.m
7. damps.m

The background to this work is presented in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the thesis which can be consulted [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ze8uW3vyteSwgiyj-zsSMsMPyhZohZBK).

Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any question.
