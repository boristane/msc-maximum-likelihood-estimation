# msc-maximum-likelihood-estimation

This repo contains the code of the machine learning (system identification) aspect of the thesis I did as part of my MSc Aerospace Dynamics at Cranfield University in 2015.

Title: [Flight Dynamics Modelling and System Identification of a Light Fixed Wing UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ze8uW3vyteSwgiyj-zsSMsMPyhZohZBK).

The code in this repo is not maintained.

It requires the [SIDPAC (System Identififcation Programcs for AirCrafts)](https://software.nasa.gov/software/LAR-16100-1) package provided by NASA. Specifically the following files:
* xsmep.m
* deriv.m
* oe.m
* model_disp.m
* tlonssd.m
* m_colores.m
* damps.m

The background to this work is presented in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the thesis.

Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any question.
